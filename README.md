# R Shiny Workshop

(https://github.com/WHOIGit/Rshinypresentation/raw/master/images/bluelogo.jpg)

Learn to advance yourself in informatics and solve the replication problem for generating figures. This repository contains the source code for the June 2018 Lunch-n-Learn workshop brought to you by the WHOI Information Services Application Development group.

## Overview
<a href = "http://shiny.rstudio.com/" target = "_blank">Shiny </a> is a UI framework from the folks at RStudio for the development of responsive, R-powered web applications. The code generates web interfaces that runs R code, but no knowlege of web-related code is needed; its pure R.


The aim of this workshop is to take you step-by-step through the construction of a reasonably full-featured app. Each step will add features to the app. All you need to do is follow along the <a href = "https://github.com/WHOIGit/Rshinypresentation/blob/master/worksheet.md" target = "_blank">worksheet </a> and copying the code from there into your Rstudio console. I will cover as many steps as possible through the class as time allows, any steps or exercises I did not cover can be done on your own time, the source code will be avaliable here.
 
 
## Prerequistes

You'll need to bring this to the workshop

1. A laptop computer with <a href = "https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download" target = "_blank">Rstudio 1.1.447 </a> installed and <a href = "http://mirrors.nics.utk.edu/cran/" target = "_blank">R 3.5.0 </a>
2. Familiarity with R: We'll assume some basic facility in R programming and that you can at least read and understand R code that creates custom plots in R's base graphics system. For the most part our explanation of R code will be limited to its relationship to app-building.
