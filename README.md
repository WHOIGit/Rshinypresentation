# R Shiny Workshop

![alt text](https://github.com/WHOIGit/Rshinypresentation/images/bluelogo.jpg "Logo Title Text 1")

Learn to advance yourself in informatics and solve the replication problem for generating figures. This repository contains the source code for the June 2018 Lunch-n-Learn workshop brought to you by the WHOI Information Services Application Development group.

## Overview
<a href = "http://shiny.rstudio.com/" target = "_blank">Shiny </a> is a UI framework from the folks at RStudio for the development of responsive, R-powered web applications. The code generates web interfaces that runs R code, but no knowlege of web-related code is needed; its pure R.


The aim of this workshop is to take you step-by-step through the construction of a reasonably full-featured app that lets students explore a dataset containing measurments of the flowers of different species of Iris. Each step will add features to the app. I will cover as many steps as possible through the class as time allows, any I did not cover can be done on your own time, the source code will be available here

## Prerequistes

You'll need to bring this to the workshop

1. A laptop computer with <a href = "https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download" target = "_blank">Rstudio 1.1.447 </a> installed
2. Familiarity with R: We'll assume some basic facility in R programming and that you can at least read and understand R code that creates custom plots in R's base graphics system. For the most part our explanation of R code will be limited to its relationship to app-building.

`we will be going over how to install shiny and dependencies during the presentation`
